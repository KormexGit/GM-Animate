## GM Animate - Easily manage sprite animations in GameMaker
GM Animate is made to be beginner friendly, and uses a GameMaker-like function structure that makes it immediately familiar.

LTS compatible! Works on any GM version 2022.0 or newer.

To get started with GM Animate, [download the newest .yymps file](https://github.com/KormexGit/GM-Animate/releases) and then check out the [basics guide](https://github.com/KormexGit/GM-Animate/wiki/Basics-Guide) for installation and usage instructions!

You can also find full documentation on the [Github wiki page](https://github.com/KormexGit/GM-Animate/wiki).

Sample project is in the repo but still WIP!

### Features:
- Doesn't interfere with GM's built in animation, so you can use both at once if desired
- Play multiple sprite animations on one object
- Check if an animation has finished or is on a specified frame
- Animation queue to automatically play animations one after another
- Pause or unpause all animations in the game at once
- Effects with animation curves!
  - Use an included curve or make your own!
  - Squash and strech, alters image_xscale and image_yscale to make a sprite "bounce". 
  - Sway, makes a sprite rotate back and forth.
  - Oscillate, makes a sprite move up and down (or any direction you choose!)
  - Shake, like a screen shake, but just for one sprite.
  - Hitstop, stop an animation for a specified number of frames.

### Planned features for the future:
- More effects!
- Attachment point editor
- Functions to automatically keep animations attached to eachother at the chosen points/angles
