# LIBRARY WIP
I made this public before it's fully finished to unlock Github wiki and get started on documentation. Releases, quick start guide, packages, etc. still pending.

## GM Animate - Tools to easily manage sprite animations in GameMaker
GM Animate is made to be beginner friendly, with functions that resemble how GameMaker built in functions look and are used. 

### Features:
- Play multiple sprite animations on one object
- Check if an animation has finished or is on a specified frame
- Animation queue to run animations in sequence
- Effects!
  - Squash and strech with animation curves. Use an included curve or make your own!
  - Shake. Like a screen shake, but just for one sprite.

### Planned features for the future:
- Attachment point editor
- Functions to automatically keep animations attached to eachother at the chosen points/angles
