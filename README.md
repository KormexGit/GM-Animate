## GM Animate - Tools to easily manage sprite animations in GameMaker
GM Animate is made to be beginner friendly, and uses a GameMaker-like function structure that makes it immediately familiar. 

To get started with GM Animate, [download the .yymps file](https://github.com/KormexGit/GM-Animate/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) and then check out the [basics guide](https://github.com/KormexGit/GM-Animate/wiki/Basics-Guide)!

### Features:
- Play multiple sprite animations on one object
- Check if an animation has finished or is on a specified frame
- Animation queue to run animations in sequence
- Effects!
  - Squash and strech with animation curves. Use an included curve or make your own!
  - Shake. Like a screen shake, but just for one sprite.
  - Hitstop. Stop an animation for a specified number of frames.

### Planned features for the future:
- Animation events
- Attachment point editor
- Functions to automatically keep animations attached to eachother at the chosen points/angles
